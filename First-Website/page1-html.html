            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>What is HTML?</b></h1>
            <p> Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the language used to create webpages. It can be assisted by other
                technologies such as: CSS and
                JavaScript.<br>
                Web browsers such as: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer,â€¦ receive HTML documents from a
                local storage or a web server and render the archives into webpages.
                HTML elements are the bricks of the webpages, they are responsible for making the structure. The
                language
                provides ways to make structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as: list,
                paragraphs, headings, links, quotes, and other items.
                The elements are delineated by tags, typed using angle brackets, here is an example:
            </p>
            <img src="img/htmlExample.png" alt="html example" class="exampleImages">
            <p>

                the elements (words between angle brackets) are not going to appear in the browser, for example, <br>the
                &lt;h1&gt; tag, is used to print out a header... so when we insert &lt;h1&gt; Big Header &lt;/h1&gt;,
                that should be the result:

            <h1>Big Header</h1>

            <img src="img/htmlExample2.png" alt="html example" class="exampleImages">

            <p>All HTML page starts with the same structure.No secrets, you can simply copy this from some place, or can
                start it on VSCode just typying "!" and hit enter, VSCode will do the rest automotically,</p>

            </p>
            <img src="img/htmlExample3.png" alt="html example image 3">

            <p>The first line is called DOCTYPE. Doctype notifies browsers, search robots, screen readers and other
                things what kind of document is the one they are about to upload. There are other codes that we can
                load, for example XML. That's why Doctype warns the browser so that it knows how to behave when reading
                the code.</p>

            <p>Then we start with the HTML tag. This means that everything between the tags is written in HTML. Next to
                the word HTML there is an attribute called lang, where we indicate the language of the text we will
                write.</p>

            <p>Right after the html tag we have the Head tag. In the Head tag we indicate the title of the document and
                indicate the table of characters that the browser must use to render its text. We can also import CSS
                pages and Scripts</p>

            <p>The title tag is very important. It is with it that you indicate the title of the document. Google and
                other search engines use this tag to indicate the title of the page in their searches. This is very
                important for you to appear well in searches.</p>
            <p><p> Though it is pretty amazing to starting making our own html pages, just the HTML language is not enough
                to make our website page look modern and beautiful. This is when our CSS content comes, if you want to
