            CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is used to personalize elements written by a markup language
            such as HTML. CSS splits the content from the visual representation of a webpage.
            using CSS, its possible to change the color of text and the background, font, paragraph spacing,
            font-size, font-family and many other functionalities.
            <p>
                The difference between a webpage that implements CSS and another that doesn't is huge.
                you have probably already seen a website that does not complete load or or has a white background with
                black
                and blue text.
                This happens because probably the CSS part was not loaded or it doesnt exist.
                And this is how a webpage with only HTML elements looks like. And its not pretty, is it?
                CSS enables you to personalize everything in a different archive. this way the style is separated from
                the
                HTML structure, which also contributes for a cleaner code.<br>In the example below you will be able to
                see how is it structure displayed:</p>

            <img src="img/cssExample.png" alt="css example image">
            <br>
            As shown, in the image above, CSS has a default structure that has to be followed, the first component to be
            inserted is the "selector",it's respondible for indicate which element you want to style. In this case you
            want to style the class ".btn" which is class for a button.
            <br>After that we make the declarations, in other words is the types of styles we want to apply in the
            selector, in the above image we have many declaration styling the width,height, changing the blackground to
            black and other things.
            <br>
            <div class="center">
            <img src="img/buttonExample.png" alt="button image example">
            <br>Example of the styles applied to the button class using CSS.
            </div>
            <p><br><br>
            Although HTML and CSS are really cool ways to build up a webpage, in the end its just design that can only
            be read.
            With JavaScript the Webpage starts to have a background process going on, there is a variety of process that
            can be done such as: colecting clients informations, enable online payments, creating accounts, display
            strategic informations and manny other uses. if you want to learn more about that click in the button
